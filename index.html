                    <h1>Motorcycles</h1>
                    <p>
                        A <b>motorcycle</b> (also called a motorbike, bike, moto or cycle) is a two, three, or four wheeled 
                        motor vehicle. Motorcycles vary considerably depending on the task they are designed for, 
                        such as long distance travel, navigating congested urban traffic, cruising, sport and racing, 
                        or off-road conditions.<br />
                        Motorcycles are one of the most affordable forms of motorised transport in many parts of the 
                        world and, for most of the world's population, they are also the most common type of motor 
                        vehicle. There are around 200 million motorcycles (including mopeds, motor scooters, 
                        motorised bicycles, and other powered two and three-wheelers) in use worldwide, or about 33 
                        motorcycles per 1000 people. This compares to around 590 million cars, or about 91 per 1000 people.<br />
                        Most of the motorcycles, 58%, are in the developing countries of Asia – Southern and Eastern Asia, and 
                        the Asia Pacific countries, excluding Japan – while 33% of the cars (195 million) are concentrated in 
                        the United States and Japan. In 2006, China had 54 million motorcycles in use and an annual production 
                        of 22 million units. As of 2002, India, with an estimated 37 million motorcycles/mopeds, was home 
                        to the largest number of motorised two wheelers in the world. China came a close second with 34 million 
                        motorcycles/mopeds.<br />Source: Wikipedia.

                        The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Petroleum Reitwagen. It was designed 
                        and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany in 1885.

                        The Triumph Tiger 110 was a British sports motorcycle first made by Triumph at their Coventry factory 
                        between 1953 and 1961. Developed from the Triumph Thunderbird the T100 first appeared in 1954.

                    <p>
                        Motorcycles must be leaned in order to make turns. This lean is induced by the method known as 
                        countersteering, in which the rider momentarily steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of 
                        the desired turn. Because it is counter-intuitive this practice is often very confusing to novices – 
                        and even to many experienced motorcyclists.
